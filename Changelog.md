## V 0.0.1
-Added Scaled Fist 1-6 and a way to train it. Currently no good description and the training recipe should be changed in the future. The balancing seems to be ok for now.
## V 0.0.2
-Added martial shards, a consumable item that raises your proficiency in the basic proficiencies/cultivation routes slightly. Currently only spawn after killing a triffid heart, melded task force, and shadow, as they seem to be strong enough to qualify as the minimum for this mod. Ant queens should also be here, once they and ants hives pose an actual challenge.
## V 0.0.3
-Added the Scaled Fist Body Cultivation manual. The recipe is no longer learned by default and there's a different one for every stage that you forget after finishing it. Martial shards only work if you have the cultivation route unlocked. The manual currently does not spawn anywhere.
