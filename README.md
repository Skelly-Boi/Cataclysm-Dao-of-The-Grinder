# Cataclysm-Dao-of-The-Grinder
Have you ever wanted to be a martial artist? The cool kind. Have you ever wanted to vomit blood and **not** miss Mt. Tai? And put your character into unnecessary amounts of danger?
### Well, look no further!
### With this mod, you too, can almost die for fractions of power!

##### The mod is not at all finished and is lacking many features.

## Current features (and spoilers, but you can't play the game blind as is):

### 'Boss' monster drops, that awaken you on the path of cultivation, and strengthen your body.
### Spell. Singular.

## To be added:

#### Many more cultivation routes, non-exclusive so you can dabble in all of them, with a few conditions and exceptions. Elemental KI types that interact with each other, which you can develop further. (ex. fire ki grows on its own by burning ki and melts ice ki, and turns water ki into steam)
#### Monsters and bosses. Much more powerful than anything vanilla has to offer.
#### Unique custom locations, such as clan headquarters... and Mt. Tai.
#### Item and mutation descriptions, filled with lore!
#### Cultivator weapons and items. Storage rings, runes, etc.
#### Spells, and transformations to increase your power for a short duration, or summon powerful elemental attacks.
#### Cultivation pills.
