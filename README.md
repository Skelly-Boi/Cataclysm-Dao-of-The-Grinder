# Cataclysm-Dao-of-The-Grinder
Have you ever wanted to be a martial artist? The cool kind. Have you ever wanted to vomit blood and not miss Mt. Tai? And put your character into unnecessary ammounts of danger?
### Well, look no further!
### With this mod, you too, can almost die for fractions of power!

##### The mod is not at all finished and is lacking of many features.

## Current features (and spoilers, but you can't play the game blind as is):

### A cultivation route, the scaled fist, that makes your fists more durable and deal more damage.
### 'Boss' monster drops, currently only the triffid heart, melded task force and shadow.

## To be added:

#### Many more cultivation routes, non-exclusive so you can dabble in all of them, with a few conditions and exceptions.
#### Monsters and bosses. Much more powerful than anything vanilla has to offer.
#### Unique custom locations, such as clan headquarters... and Mt. Tai.
#### Item and mutation descriptions, filled with lore!
#### Cultivator weapons.
#### Spells, and transformations to increase your power for a short duration.
#### Cultivation pills.
