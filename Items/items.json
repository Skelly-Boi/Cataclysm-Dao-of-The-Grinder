    "description": "This crystaline shard while seeming ethereal has an actual physical form, and a lot of energy.  Consuming this shard induces a breakthrough in one's mentality and dao, letting them quickly advance in their techniques.  Despite originating from a living creature, the detection and extraction of this shard is trivial to any martially gifted individual, the shard being drawn towards them and exiting the previous host on its own.",
